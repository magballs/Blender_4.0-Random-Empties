# Blender_4.0-Random-Empties
Creating a small script to randomize movements for empty planes, for texture coordinates in Blender.

In Blender, you can use objects to create texture effects by manipulating it's movemements. Trying to learn Blender and Python at the same time, and learn good practices, I am also publishing on GitHub.
The script defines which objects, and its interpolation, and creates random movements on the X, Y and Z coordinates for a set timeframe. It should also set keyframes at set intervalls.
